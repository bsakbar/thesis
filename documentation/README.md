**Description**

Blood is a fascinating component of the human body. With only a few drops of blood, we can learn a lot about the conditions of our bodies. However, blood test results are usually conveyed in a complex format that is not understandable by everyone. Therefore, I built an interface that translates intricate blood test results into a simple and standardized format using interactive visualizations. The goal of this project is to provide a tool for patients to easily understand their health and bodies.
